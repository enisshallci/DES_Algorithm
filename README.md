# DES Encryption and Decryption

This repository contains implementations for encryption and decryption using the **Data Encryption Standard (DES)** algorithm. DES is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data. The implementations provided here support both encryption and decryption processes.

## Description
The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key algorithm that encrypts 64-bit blocks of data using a 56-bit key. The algorithm performs an initial permutation, 16 rounds of processing (which include expansion, substitution, permutation, and XOR operations), followed by a final permutation to produce the ciphertext.
